# Practice O-SPAN Task Setup Instructions

This project provides a template and environment for practicing task-related coding with the Operation Span Task. Follow the steps below to prepare your workspace and track your progress.

## Files to Open

Make sure you have the following files open in your code editor:

### JavaScript Files (`static/js/`)
- `task.js`  
  This is the main script that controls the task logic.

- `modifier.js`  
  This file is used to adjust task parameters and conditions.

### Room Builder File (`static/rooms/`)
- `room_maker.js`  
  Defines and generates room layouts or environments.

## Checking Your Progress

To test your changes:

1. Locate the `exp.html` file in the `templates/` directory.
2. Open `exp.html` in a web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox).
3. Refresh the page in the browser after each change to see updates.

## Editing Instructions

Every part of the code that you need to modify or add to is clearly marked in the source files.

- Required edits are labeled as `Q1` through `Q8`.  
  Follow them in order (Q1, Q2, ..., Q8) to complete the full task.

- Optional practice sections are marked as `Optional:`  
  These are additional challenges you can try after completing Q1â€“Q8.

## Tips

- Open the browser console (right-click > Inspect > Console) to view logs and error messages.
- Save your work regularly and reload `exp.html` to test changes.
- If something breaks, check for typos, missing semicolons, or logic errors.

This setup is designed to help you practice and understand the components of the task in a structured way.
